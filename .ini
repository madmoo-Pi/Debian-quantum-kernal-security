Intrusion Detection (Fail2ban)

```ini
# Current fail2ban
[sshd]
enabled = true
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600

# Our enhancement:
[sshd]
enabled = true
maxretry = 2  # Catch earlier
bantime = 3600
# ADD: Trigger kernel collapse on 1st suspicious attempt
action = iptables-multiport
         quantum-collapse[name=SSH, pid=%(pid)s]
# SSH port internally changes during attack
```
